## Mod Description

A vanilla-style mod adhering to the philosophy of *"Less is More"*. It adds just a few practical new arrows to the game, yet brings more fun to your adventures!

- **Explosive Arrow**: Triggers a small explosion on impact, ideal for taking on groups of mobs without damaging the terrain.

- **Small Fireball Arrow(Fire Charge Arrow)**: Launches a homing fire charge that chases enemies, dealing fire damage with stunning visual effects.

- **Fireball Arrow**: Launches fireballs (like a Ghast) that home in on enemies

Fully aligned with vanilla gameplay logic, no extra complicated mechanics—this mod enriches your bow with more tactical options through pure, straightforward new content.

## Why This Mod?
I suddenly realized that fire charges have extremely limited use cases in the vanilla game, simply because you can’t throw them directly—while blaze mobs hurl fireballs right at you... That’s when the idea struck: why not make fire charges more useful?

## A Little Side Note
*I originally planned to create a Ghast-like Fireball Arrow, but a code error turned it into a Fire Charge Arrow instead—haha!*

*So I just went with two arrows in the end: one explosive, one fire charge.*
